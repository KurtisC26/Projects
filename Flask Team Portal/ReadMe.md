<h2>NBA Team Portal </h2>

<h4>IN PROGRESS</h4>

<br>
<br>
My goal is to create a website/flask app where a user can select the nba team, and view the website as an analytics portal. 

<br>
Current features I am working on:
<ul>
  <li>Home page with quick analysis of last 5 games using chart.js</li>
  <li>Schedule page with an overview of the current season</li>
  <li>Automated post game report. A page dedicated to a stats review of the most recent completed game</li>
  <li>Custom stats tracking template, and the ability to download the csv file</li>
  <li>Scouting report generator for a selected opponent</li>
</ul>
