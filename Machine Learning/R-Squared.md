<h2> R-Squared </h2>
R-Squared is a metric used to evaluate regression models. It can be described as the impact on y based on the incrimental change of x.

It is calculated by taking the sum of squares of the residuals devided by the total sum of suqares of the average.


We want to try and fit a line that minimizes the sum of squars of residuals

  R-Squared gets less accurate as you add variables to linear models. As you add coeficiants and variables, the regresion process will not degrease r-square making it less of a good metric to use to evaluate a model

  <h2>Adjusted R-Squared </h2>
  
  It will punish the model if variables are not correlated
