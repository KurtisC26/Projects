<h2> Project Portfolio</h2>

Hello! 

Welcome to my project portfolio! The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my telents in data science, but also my business insights. 

The folders starting with a number ex: 2. F1 Analysis are individual projects that I have completed in my spre time. 

The other folders will be more theoriticall but showcase skills and how I apply them to solve a problem or deliver insights within a context
