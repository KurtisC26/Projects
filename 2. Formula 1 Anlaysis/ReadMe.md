<h2>F1 Telemetry Analysis </h2>

This was an exploratory project for me to help learn the basics in computer vision. The script is able to watch a screen recording of the timing section in the Formula 1 application, and product a telemtry graph showing the speed over time throughout a lap. My goal was to create a script where I can select multiple videos and product a graph that compares the cornering speeds, breaking points and top speeds between the two drivers.
