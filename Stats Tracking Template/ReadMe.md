<h2> Basketball Stats Tracking Template </h2>
This is a template that allows custom stats tracking with an emphasis on play calling and team execution. 
<br>
<br>
General customization for you team:
<br>
1) Download the folder
<br>
2) Adjust the list of player numbers in the position and player variables starting on line 40 of the index.html file
<br>
3) Enter custom play calls starting on line 170
<br>
4) Save to start tracking statistics, and export csv file to analyze

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
I plan on eventually releasing some Python and R files as analysis guides breaking down the csv output from the template
